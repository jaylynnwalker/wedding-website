                <li><u>WEATHER</u>: The average low temperatures in Jodhpur in January is 51&degF and the average high is 75&degF. Expect chilly mornings and nights and warm afternoons. Plan to wear warm clothes for the evening events.</li>
                <li><u>FOOTWEAR</u>: There are not many cement paved walkways at the venues. The walkways will be a mixture of grass, gravel, and stones. We suggest wearing footwear that will allow you to be stable on various surfaces.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>The Cookout</h1>
            <h2>Sunday, January 4th</h2>
            <h3> Event History</h3>
            <p>Black people love a good cookout. It’s a time for us to reunite and bond with our friends and family. Cookouts can be traced back to African culinary traditions, where cooking over open flames was common. This practice continued throughout slavery into the Civil Rights era. For much of our history, African Americans had no choice but to cook outdoors because of inadequate housing. As an alternative, African Americans turned to alleys and public parks to do their cooking. In time, the cookout became synonymous with backyard barbecues. Cookouts remain a staple in the Black community as they provide us with a safe space to relax and take a break from the discriminatory environments we encounter daily. This event is not complete without classic soul/hip-hop music, line dancing, and card games. First cookout? Not to worry...the only requirements are to come with an empty belly, dance moves, and a spirit for the community!</p>
            <p> Welcome to The Cookout!</p>

            <h3>Attire</h3>
            <p>This event will be casual dress! Wear something comfortable that allows you to relax after your long travel. Anything that you would wear to a backyard party is acceptable. This is an evening event, so dress in warm clothing. Check out the Pinterest board below for some inspiration.</p>

            <h1>Haldi</h1>
            <h2>Monday, January 5th</h2>
            <h3> Event History</h3>
            <p>The Haldi ceremony in Gujarat wedding traditions is a significant pre-wedding ritual with deep cultural and spiritual roots. Traditionally held a day or two before the wedding, this ceremony involves applying a paste made from turmeric, sandalwood, and other ingredients to the bride and groom. The practice is believed to bless the couple, purify their bodies, and ward off evil spirits. The yellow color of the turmeric symbolizes prosperity and is thought to bring good luck. The Haldi ceremony is also a time of joy and celebration, with family and friends coming together to sing, dance, and shower the couple with blessings. This ritual, rich in symbolism and cultural importance, underscores the vibrant traditions and communal bonds inherent in Gujarati weddings.</p>

            <h3>Attire</h3>
            <p>Please wear semi-formal attire in shades of yellow to this event. Feel free to dress in Indian or Non-Indian clothing. All styles are welcome as long as they are yellow!</p>

            <h1>Garba</h1>
            <h2>Monday, January 5th</h2>
            <h3> Event History</h3>
            <p>We will be combining the two events of Garba and Mehndi. Garba is a dance originally performed to honor Goddess Durga. The dance is performed in a circle, often around a shrine of Goddess Durga. The dance movements symbolize the cycles of life, representing the unity and harmony between participants and the divine. Over time, this devotional dance evolved into a lively social event, particularly in weddings, where it serves as a celebration of joy, community, and the couple’s upcoming union. </p>
            <p>The Mehndi ceremony is a cherished pre-wedding ritual, where intricate henna designs are applied to the bride's hands and feet. Mehndi symbolizes beauty, love, and the bride's transition into a new phase of life. The ceremony is filled with songs, laughter, and festivities, as close family and friends gather to celebrate the bride’s journey. The fusion of Garba and Mehndi brings together two vibrant traditions: the communal dance of Garba and the intimate, symbolic rituals of Mehndi.</p>

            <h3>Attire</h3>
            <p>This event is formal dress. American or Indian style dress is acceptable. Check out the pictures below for ideas.</p>

            <h1>Wedding Ceremony</h1>
            <h2>Tuesday, January 6th</h2>
            <h3> Event History</h3>
            <p>Our wedding will be a mix of Gujarati and Black American wedding traditions. Gujarati wedding ceremonies are rooted in Hindu traditions. Traditionally, these weddings have been elaborate affairs, rich in rituals that emphasize the sanctity and spiritual significance of marriage. Despite modern influences, Gujarati weddings have preserved their core values of familial ties, cultural respect, and spiritual unity. </p>
            <p>Black wedding traditions, like jumping the broom, date back to slavery when Black people were not allowed to legally marry. Over the years, Black wedding traditions have evolved to incorporate both African traditions and Western influences, often featuring gospel music and vibrant attire that reflects cultural pride. Faith, particularly Christianity, plays a central role in many ceremonies, with scripture readings and blessings. These traditions honor history while celebrating love, family, and unity.</p>

            <h3>Attire</h3>
            <p>Please wear formal attire to this event. The wedding ceremony will take place in the afternoon, so the temperature will likely be warm. There will also be about 0.25 miles (0.8 km) of walking as part of the procession.</p>

            <h2>Tuesday, January 6th</h2>
            <h3> Event History</h3>
            <p>White parties hold a special place in Black culture. They started to gain popularity in the Black community in the 1920s when Black elites hosted social events for the summer during the Harlem Renaissance. White parties increased in popularity as they were adopted by the Divine Nine and high-class celebrities. Throughout this time, all white themes became synonymous with elegance and exclusivity.</p>
